# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Aura One ("the App", "we", "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information. The fundamental principle of Aura One is that **your data stays on your device**.

## 2. Core Privacy Principles

- **Local-First**: All data is stored exclusively on your device
- **No Cloud by Default**: We do not operate any servers or cloud services
- **You Own Your Data**: Complete data ownership and control remains with you
- **No Tracking**: We do not track, monitor, or analyze your usage
- **No Ads**: We do not serve advertisements or use advertising networks

## 3. Information Collection

### What We DON'T Collect

We do NOT collect, transmit, or have access to:
- Your journal entries
- Your photos or videos
- Your location data
- Your calendar events
- Your health and fitness data
- Your personal information
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Device identifiers
- IP addresses
- Any other personal data

### Device Permissions

The App may request the following permissions, all of which are OPTIONAL:

- **Location Services**: To create location-based memories and maps (stays on device)
- **Photo Library**: To include your photos in journal entries (stays on device)
- **Calendar**: To incorporate events into your journal (stays on device)
- **Health Data**: To log fitness activities (stays on device)
- **Bluetooth**: To detect proximity to other devices running the App (stays on device)
- **Microphone**: For voice journaling and commands (processed on device)

You can deny or revoke any permission at any time through your device settings.

### Optional Location Name Services (Reverse Geocoding)

**IMPORTANT**: The App offers an OPTIONAL feature to convert GPS coordinates into readable location names (e.g., "Starbucks" instead of "Location"). This feature:

- **Is OFF by default** - You must explicitly enable it
- **Requires internet connection** - GPS coordinates are sent to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service
- **Is clearly marked** - You will see a warning before enabling this feature
- **Can be disabled anytime** - Toggle off in Privacy Settings

When reverse geocoding is DISABLED (default):
- Your locations appear as generic "Location" markers
- NO GPS data leaves your device
- Complete privacy is maintained

When reverse geocoding is ENABLED (optional):
- GPS coordinates are sent to OpenStreetMap's free service
- Location names are cached locally to minimize requests
- You get readable place names in your journal

This is the ONLY feature that transmits location data externally, and it's completely optional.

## 4. Data Storage

### Local Storage

- All data is stored in a local database on your device
- Data is not encrypted by default (relies on device-level encryption)
- Deleting the App will permanently delete all locally stored data
- We cannot recover data that is lost or deleted from your device

### Optional Backup Features

If you choose to enable backup features:
- Data is encrypted on your device before transmission
- You select and control the backup destination
- Supported options may include your own cloud storage accounts
- We never have access to your backup credentials or data
- You are responsible for the security and privacy policies of third-party backup services

## 5. Data Processing

### On-Device AI

- All AI processing happens locally on your device
- No data is sent to external AI services
- AI models run entirely offline
- Generated content never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it

### No Analytics or Tracking

- We do not use any analytics services
- We do not track usage patterns
- We do not collect crash reports
- We do not monitor performance metrics

## 6. Data Sharing

We do NOT share your data with anyone because we never have access to it.

### Optional Sharing Features

If you choose to use optional sharing features:
- Content is shared directly from your device
- You control what, when, and with whom you share
- Shared content is subject to the privacy policies of the platforms you share to

## 7. Data Security

### Your Responsibility

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Device security is your responsibility
- Use device lock screens and encryption
- Keep your device software updated
- Be cautious about device physical security

### App Security

- The App uses standard security practices for local data storage
- Optional backup features use end-to-end encryption
- We cannot guarantee absolute security of data on your device

## 8. Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: View all your data within the App
- **Export**: Export your data in standard formats at any time
- **Delete**: Delete any or all data directly from the App
- **Portability**: Take your data with you in machine-readable formats
- **Control**: Manage all permissions and features

## 9. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any data, this is enforced by the honor system.

## 10. Open Source Transparency

As an open-source application:
- Our code is publicly auditable
- You can verify our privacy claims
- Security researchers can review our implementation
- Community contributions are subject to the same privacy standards

## 11. Third-Party Services

### No Default Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services by default.

### Optional Integrations

If you enable optional features that connect to third-party services:
- You are subject to their privacy policies
- We do not control how they handle data
- We recommend reviewing their privacy practices
- Examples: Google Drive, Dropbox (for backups)

## 12. International Users

Since your data stays on your device:
- No international data transfers occur by default
- You are subject to your local data protection laws
- Optional backup services may transfer data internationally based on your configuration

## 13. Changes to This Policy

- We may update this Privacy Policy periodically
- Significant changes will be noted in the App
- Your continued use constitutes acceptance of changes
- Previous versions will remain available in our repository

## 14. Data Retention

- Data is retained on your device until you delete it
- We have no ability to delete your data remotely
- Uninstalling the App will delete all local data
- Backup data (if configured) follows your backup provider's retention policies

## 15. No Warranty on Privacy

While we've designed the App with privacy as a core principle:
- We cannot guarantee absolute privacy
- Device vulnerabilities may expose data
- User actions may compromise privacy
- Third-party integrations have their own privacy implications

## 16. Contact Information

For privacy-related questions:
- Review our open-source documentation
- Submit issues to our repository
- Contact us through official support channels

## 17. Compliance

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with:
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

However, since we don't collect data, most provisions don't apply.

## 18. Summary

**Simply put**: Your data stays on your device. We can't see it, access it, or sell it. You own it completely. The App is designed to work without any internet connection, and you decide if and how to back up your data.

## 19. Acceptance

By using Aura One, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
