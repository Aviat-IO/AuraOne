## Implementation Details

### Pattern Learning Algorithm

```dart
// Learn from 30 days of historical data
Future<void> learnUserPatterns() async {
  // Analyze activity patterns
  for (final data in historicalData) {
    // Track activity frequency
    _activityFrequency[activity] = count;

    // Track location-activity associations
    _locationActivities[location].add(activity);

    // Track time-based patterns
    _dailyPatterns.add(DailyPattern(
      hour: hour,
      activity: activity,
      location: location,
      confidence: confidence,
    ));
  }

  // Calculate emotional trends
  _calculateEmotionalTrends(historicalData);
}
```

### Emotional Insight Generation

```dart
// Generate insights based on data patterns
List<String> _generateEmotionalInsights(data) {
  // Social interaction analysis
  if (socialScore > 10) {
    "ü§ù High social engagement - great for wellbeing!"
  }

  // Physical activity analysis
  if (activeMinutes > 30) {
    "üí™ Excellent physical activity - X active minutes!"
  }

  // Location variety analysis
  if (uniqueLocations > 3) {
    "üó∫Ô∏è Diverse day with X locations - variety enriches life!"
  }
}
```

### Wellness Score Calculation

```dart
double _calculateWellnessScore(data) {
  double score = 50.0; // Base score

  // Physical activity (up to +20)
  score += min(20.0, activePoints * 2.0);

  // Social interaction (up to +15)
  score += min(15.0, socialScore * 1.5);

  // Location variety (up to +10)
  score += min(10.0, locations * 3.0);

  // Photo memories (up to +5)
  score += min(5.0, photos * 0.5);

  return min(100.0, score);
}
```
