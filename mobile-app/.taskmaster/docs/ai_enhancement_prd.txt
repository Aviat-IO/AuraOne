# Aura One AI Enhancement Project

## Overview
Enhance the Aura One wellness app with advanced AI capabilities for generating rich, contextual daily summaries from user data.

## Background
The app currently uses basic image captioning for photos but needs higher quality object detection and multi-modal data fusion to create meaningful daily summaries that combine photos, location data, and movement patterns.

## Goals
- Implement high-quality on-device object detection for photos
- Create multi-modal data fusion engine combining photos, location, and movement
- Generate rich, contextual daily summaries with narrative intelligence
- Maintain 100% user privacy with all processing on-device

## Requirements

### Phase 1: High-Quality Object Detection (COMPLETED)
- Implement ML Kit object detection with zero model downloads
- Detect multiple objects, faces, text, and scene context
- Optimize confidence thresholds for quality
- Maintain 100% on-device processing

### Phase 2: Multi-Modal Data Fusion Engine
- Combine photo analysis with location data
- Integrate movement patterns (walking, driving, stationary)
- Create temporal context from timestamps
- Build activity inference system
- Design unified data model for fused information

### Phase 3: Personal Daily Context Engine
- Generate natural language narratives from fused data
- Create personalized daily summaries
- Implement context-aware descriptions
- Add emotional and wellness insights
- Build adaptive learning from user patterns

## Technical Constraints
- All processing must be on-device (no cloud APIs)
- Zero network calls for AI processing
- Minimal battery and memory impact
- Fast performance (< 1 second per photo)
- No model downloads required

## Success Metrics
- Object detection accuracy > 80%
- Daily summary generation < 5 seconds
- User satisfaction with summary quality
- Zero privacy concerns
- Battery impact < 5% daily usage
