# AI-Enhanced Journal Generation - Technical Specification

## Overview

This document captures the complete technical specification for the AI-enhanced journal generation system implemented in the Aura One mobile application. The system transforms basic data collection into intelligent life chronicling through on-device AI processing.

## Project Vision
