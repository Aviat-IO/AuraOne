# Task ID: 3
# Title: Location Services Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement passive location tracking and geofencing for automatic day mapping
# Details:
Integrate location package for background location services with proper permission handling. Implement LocationService class that monitors significant location changes and stores them in the database. Add geofencing capabilities to detect when users arrive/leave significant locations. Implement battery-efficient location tracking with configurable accuracy and frequency settings. Ensure compliance with platform background execution limits.

# Test Strategy:
Test location permission flows. Verify background location tracking accuracy and battery impact. Test geofencing triggers and location history storage. Validate location data privacy and local storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add location package and configure permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate location package dependency and configure platform-specific location permissions
### Details:
Add location package to pubspec.yaml. Configure location permissions in Android manifest (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) and iOS Info.plist (NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription, NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription). Set up permission request flows for runtime permission handling.

## 2. Implement LocationService class with background tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create LocationService class to handle background location monitoring and significant location changes
### Details:
Implement LocationService with methods for starting/stopping background location tracking. Configure location stream listeners for significant location changes. Handle location accuracy settings and update frequency. Implement error handling for location service failures and GPS unavailability.

## 3. Add geofencing capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement geofencing to detect arrival and departure from significant locations
### Details:
Add geofencing functionality to detect when users enter or exit predefined geographical areas. Implement geofence creation, monitoring, and event handling. Create system to identify and automatically create geofences for frequently visited locations. Handle geofence trigger events and notifications.

## 4. Configure battery-efficient tracking settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement power-optimized location tracking with configurable accuracy and frequency
### Details:
Configure location tracking for optimal battery usage with adjustable accuracy levels (high, medium, low power). Implement intelligent tracking frequency based on user movement patterns. Add settings for minimum distance and time intervals between location updates. Create adaptive tracking that reduces frequency when stationary.

## 5. Handle platform background execution limits [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Ensure compliance with Android and iOS background execution policies
### Details:
Implement foreground service for Android background location tracking with proper notification. Handle iOS background app refresh limitations and significant location change APIs. Configure proper background modes in iOS Info.plist. Implement graceful degradation when background permissions are denied.

## 6. Implement location data storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create database schema and storage system for location history and geofencing data
### Details:
Design and implement database tables for storing location points, geofences, and location events. Create data models for LocationPoint and GeofenceEvent. Implement efficient querying for location history by date/time ranges. Add data retention policies and cleanup for old location data.

## 7. Add privacy controls and permission flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.6
### Description: Implement user-facing privacy controls and permission management UI
### Details:
Create permission request UI with clear explanations of location usage. Implement privacy settings allowing users to control location tracking granularity and data retention. Add location history viewing and deletion capabilities. Create opt-out mechanisms and data export for location information.
