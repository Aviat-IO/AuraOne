		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "App Initialization and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into: 1) Running rename_app script with new identity, 2) Updating app icons and splash screen branding, 3) Configuring app metadata and descriptions, 4) Implementing error handling and logging infrastructure",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. The rename script exists and handles most work automatically. Main effort is branding assets and logging setup. Current app shows 'Purplestack' throughout and uses standard Flutter structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Core Database Schema and Models",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Design journal-specific database schema, 2) Create JournalEntry model with Drift, 3) Create MediaItem model with relationships, 4) Create LocationEvent model, 5) Create CalendarEvent and PersonTag models, 6) Implement database indices and migration support",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Requires extending existing Purplebase SQLite to add 5 new model types with proper relationships. Current codebase only has basic Nostr models. Need Drift integration, indices, and foreign key relationships."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Location Services Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Add location package and permissions, 2) Implement LocationService class with background tracking, 3) Add geofencing capabilities, 4) Configure battery-efficient tracking settings, 5) Handle platform background execution limits, 6) Implement location data storage, 7) Add privacy controls and permission flows",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. No current location services in codebase. Requires new package integration, background services, geofencing, battery optimization, and complex platform-specific permission handling. Android manifest shows only basic internet permission."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Photo and Media Library Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Integrate photo_manager package, 2) Implement PhotoService for media scanning, 3) Add EXIF metadata extraction, 4) Integrate google_mlkit_face_detection, 5) Implement face clustering algorithms, 6) Create media database models, 7) Handle various media formats (JPEG, HEIC, MP4), 8) Optimize performance for large media collections",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. No current media handling in codebase. Requires multiple package integrations (photo_manager, exif, ML Kit), computer vision for face detection, complex metadata extraction, and performance optimization. Face clustering is particularly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Calendar and System Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Implement iOS EventKit integration, 2) Implement Android Calendar Provider integration, 3) Add HealthKit integration (iOS), 4) Add Google Fit integration (Android), 5) Implement BLE scanning with flutter_blue_plus, 6) Create CalendarService with privacy controls, 7) Handle data attribution and source tracking",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. No current system integrations. Requires platform-specific APIs for calendar and health data, plus BLE integration. Multiple permission flows and privacy considerations. Cross-platform implementation challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "On-Device AI Text Generation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Integrate tflite_flutter package, 2) Select and optimize mobile language model (Gemma), 3) Implement AIService class architecture, 4) Create data synthesis pipeline, 5) Develop prompt engineering templates, 6) Add fallback text generation, 7) Optimize model performance and memory usage, 8) Handle model loading and inference errors",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. No current AI capabilities. Requires TensorFlow Lite integration, mobile model optimization, complex data synthesis from multiple sources, prompt engineering, and significant performance optimization. Mobile AI is resource-intensive."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Voice-to-Text Editing Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Integrate speech_to_text package, 2) Implement VoiceEditingService, 3) Create NLP command parsing logic, 4) Build voice recording UI, 5) Add text-to-speech for feedback, 6) Handle microphone permissions and audio quality",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. No current speech capabilities. Requires speech recognition, natural language processing for commands, audio UI components, and bidirectional audio (recording and playback). Complex intent parsing needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Daily Canvas User Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Design main daily journal layout, 2) Implement timeline/calendar navigation, 3) Create interactive map widget with flutter_map, 4) Build media gallery with optimization, 5) Implement rich text editor with markdown, 6) Add skeleton loading states, 7) Ensure responsive design across screen sizes",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Current codebase has basic Flutter UI framework and some packages (table_calendar, cached_network_image). Main challenge is integrating multiple complex UI components and ensuring good UX across different data types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Data Export and Backup System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Design export data format and schema, 2) Implement local file system export, 3) Add Google Drive integration with googleapis, 4) Implement Syncthing folder sync, 5) Add Blossom decentralized storage, 6) Implement client-side encryption, 7) Create Nostr integration for selective sharing, 8) Add backup scheduling and monitoring",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Current Nostr integration exists but limited. Requires multiple backup destinations, encryption implementation, cloud service integrations, and comprehensive data serialization. Multiple external API integrations needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Privacy Controls and Permissions Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Design granular privacy settings UI, 2) Implement permission request flows, 3) Create privacy dashboard with data visualization, 4) Add selective data deletion tools, 5) Implement app lock with biometric authentication, 6) Ensure privacy controls accessibility and documentation",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Builds on other tasks' permission systems. Requires comprehensive UI for privacy controls, biometric integration, and data management tools. Less complex than core features but requires careful UX design for trust."
