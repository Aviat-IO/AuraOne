# Task ID: 21
# Title: Local AI Models for Daily Summary Generation (KEY FEATURE)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 17, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: critical
# Description: Implement comprehensive 4-stage on-device AI pipeline using AI-SPEC.md specifications for generating intelligent daily summaries from multimodal sensor, location, and photo data using Google Gemma 3 Nano.
# Details:
Build upon existing AI infrastructure from Task 6 and 17 to create a production-ready 4-stage AI pipeline following AI-SPEC.md specifications. Stage 1 (Spatiotemporal Analysis): Implement DBSCAN with grid-based optimization for location clustering and CNN-LSTM models for Human Activity Recognition, creating structured Stay/Journey events. Stage 2 (Visual Context): Deploy MobileNet/EfficientNet for scene recognition and object detection, plus LightCap model for image captioning. Stage 3&4 (Unified Multimodal Summarization): Use Google Gemma 3 Nano (2B/4B parameters) via flutter_gemma package for native multimodal processing of text, image, and audio inputs. Handle model download on first launch (not bundled) and implement Gemma Terms of Use licensing requirements. Use tflite_flutter for preprocessing models (HAR, vision) and flutter_gemma for narrative generation. Enable hardware acceleration (NNAPI on Android, Core ML on iOS). Implement model quantization, run inference in isolates to prevent UI blocking, add progressive fallback strategies, and consider optional differential privacy for GPS data. All processing remains strictly on-device with no external data transmission.

# Test Strategy:
Test 4-stage AI pipeline performance across various mobile devices with different specifications. Benchmark each stage individually: spatiotemporal processing (DBSCAN clustering accuracy, HAR model precision/recall), visual context extraction (scene recognition accuracy, caption quality), and multimodal summarization (Gemma 3 Nano inference time, memory usage). Validate model download and licensing compliance on first launch. Test hardware acceleration on both Android (NNAPI) and iOS (Core ML). Verify all processing remains local with network monitoring. Test progressive fallback strategies under resource constraints. Validate summary quality across diverse multimodal scenarios combining location, activity, and photo data.

## 2. Stage 1: Spatiotemporal Data Processing - Location Clustering with DBSCAN [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement grid-based optimized DBSCAN algorithm to identify significant stay points from GPS coordinates
### Details:
Process time-series GPS coordinates following AI-SPEC.md specifications to identify significant locations where user spent time. Implement grid-based optimized DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering) algorithm in Dart to cluster GPS points into stay points and journeys with improved performance. Configure parameters: eps (distance in meters for neighborhood radius), MinPts (minimum GPS points within eps radius to define core point). Apply grid-based spatial indexing for O(n log n) complexity improvement. Output list of GPS points labeled with cluster ID (significant place) or noise (journey). Implement optional differential privacy for GPS data protection. Use existing location data from Task 3.
<info added on 2025-09-12T07:40:17.643Z>
DBSCAN implementation should output structured Event objects with type field set to either 'Stay' or 'Journey'. For Stay events: include precise location coordinates, start_time when user arrived, and end_time when user left the significant location. For Journey events: capture movement trajectory with start/end coordinates and timestamps representing travel between stay points. Grid-based preprocessing optimization must divide geographical coverage area into uniform cells, map each GPS point to its corresponding grid cell, calculate point density per cell, then apply DBSCAN algorithm only to high-density cells and their immediate neighbors. This reduces computational complexity from O(nÂ²) to approximately O(n log n) making it feasible for processing 5-10K daily GPS points on mobile devices. Memory-efficient implementation should process GPS data in streaming fashion rather than loading entire dataset into memory simultaneously. Reference AI-SPEC Section 2.1 for specific parameter tuning guidelines and performance benchmarks.
