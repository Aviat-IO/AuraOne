# Task ID: 1
# Title: App Initialization and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup the core application identity, branding, and configuration for the Aura One journaling app
# Details:
Use the existing rename_app.dart script to change app name from 'Purplestack' to 'Aura One' and update package identifier from 'com.example.purplestack' to 'com.auraone.app'. Update app icon, splash screen, and basic branding elements. Configure app metadata and descriptions to reflect the journaling app purpose. Implement proper error handling and logging infrastructure for production use.

# Test Strategy:
Verify app installs with correct name and icon on target platforms. Test that all package references are updated correctly. Validate app launches without errors and displays correct branding.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Execute rename_app script with new identity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the existing rename_app.dart script to change app name from 'Purplestack' to 'Aura One' and update package identifier from 'com.example.purplestack' to 'com.auraone.app'
### Details:
Use the rename_app.dart script in the tools/scripts directory to update all app identifiers, package names, and references throughout the Flutter project structure. This includes updating AndroidManifest.xml, iOS Info.plist, pubspec.yaml, and all other configuration files that contain the old app identity.

## 2. Update app icons and splash screen branding [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Replace default app icons and splash screen with Aura One branding elements across all platforms
### Details:
Create or obtain Aura One app icons in required sizes for Android (mipmap densities) and iOS (AppIcon.appiconset). Update splash screen images and colors to match the journaling app theme. Ensure icons are properly configured in platform-specific directories and manifest files.

## 3. Configure app metadata and descriptions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Update all app metadata, descriptions, and store listings to reflect the journaling app purpose
### Details:
Update app descriptions in pubspec.yaml, AndroidManifest.xml, and iOS Info.plist to describe Aura One as a journaling application. Configure appropriate app categories, permissions descriptions, and user-facing text to clearly communicate the app's purpose and data usage for journaling functionality.

## 4. Implement error handling and logging infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up comprehensive error handling and logging system for production use
### Details:
Implement global error handling using Flutter's ErrorWidget.builder and PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError. Set up structured logging using packages like logger or similar. Configure crash reporting and error tracking for production builds. Add debug logging for development and filtered logging for release builds. Ensure sensitive journal data is never logged.
