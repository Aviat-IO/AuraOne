# Title: Standardized Bottom Navigation Tab Behavior with Consistent Visual States
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Standardize the bottom navigation bar by removing unique home button styling and implementing consistent behavior where inactive tabs show only icons and active tabs display icon, text label, and background color with smooth transitions.
# Details:
Implement a unified bottom navigation system that treats all tabs consistently. Remove any special styling from the home button that makes it appear different from other tabs. Create a custom BottomNavigationBarItem widget that handles two distinct states: 1) Inactive state - displays only the icon centered in the tab area with no text or background styling, 2) Active state - shows the icon, text label below it, and a subtle background color/highlight. Implement smooth AnimationController-based transitions (300-400ms duration) that handle: icon vertical position changes (slight upward movement when active), text opacity fade-in/out with slide animation, background color fade-in/out using ColorTween. Use Material 3 design tokens for colors, ensuring the active background uses theme.colorScheme.primaryContainer or secondaryContainer. Implement proper state management to ensure only one tab can be active at a time. Handle rapid tab switching by properly disposing/interrupting ongoing animations to prevent visual glitches. Consider using AnimatedSwitcher or custom AnimatedBuilder widgets for smooth state transitions. Ensure the animation timing follows Material Design motion principles with appropriate easing curves (Curves.easeInOut or Curves.fastOutSlowIn).

# Test Strategy:
Test that all navigation tabs (Search, History, Home, Privacy, Settings) display consistently in inactive state with only icons visible and no text or special background. Verify active state shows icon, text label, and background highlight for each tab. Test smooth transitions when switching between tabs, ensuring animations complete properly without visual glitches. Validate that rapid tab switching doesn't cause animation conflicts or performance issues. Test animation performance across different device types and screen sizes. Verify that the standardized behavior maintains accessibility features like semantic labels and proper touch targets. Confirm that theme changes (light/dark mode) properly update the active tab background colors and maintain appropriate contrast ratios.
