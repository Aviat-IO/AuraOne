# Title: Replace logging TODO in context_providers.dart with proper error logging implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace the TODO comment at line 74 in context_providers.dart with proper error logging implementation using the existing AppLogger utility for better error tracking and debugging in the PersonalContextEngine narrative generation.
# Details:
Replace the TODO comment 'Replace with proper logging' at line 74 in context_providers.dart with proper error logging implementation. The project already has a comprehensive logging system using the logger package and AppLogger utility class in lib/utils/logger.dart. Implementation steps: 1) Import the existing AppLogger by adding 'import '../utils/logger.dart';' to the imports section of context_providers.dart, 2) Replace the TODO comment and basic print statement with proper error logging using appLogger.error() method that includes the error object, stackTrace, and contextual information about the narrative generation failure, 3) Add appropriate error context such as the date parameter and engine state to help with debugging, 4) Consider using appLogger.warning() for non-critical errors that shouldn't crash the app but should be tracked, 5) Ensure the logging follows the existing pattern used throughout the codebase where errors are logged but don't prevent the method from returning a safe fallback value (null in this case).

# Test Strategy:
Test error logging by triggering narrative generation failures and verifying proper error messages appear in the console with appropriate log levels. Test that the logging doesn't interfere with the app's functionality and null is still returned when errors occur. Verify that logged errors include sufficient context information (date, error details, stack trace) for debugging purposes. Test both debug and release builds to ensure logging behaves correctly according to the AppLogger configuration (debug logs only in debug mode, warnings and errors in both modes).
