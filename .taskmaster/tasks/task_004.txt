# Task ID: 4
# Title: Photo and Media Library Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build automatic photo discovery and metadata extraction system
# Details:
Use photo_manager package to access device media library. Implement PhotoService to scan for new photos/videos created each day. Extract EXIF metadata including GPS coordinates, timestamps, and camera settings using exif package. Implement on-device face detection using google_mlkit_face_detection and face clustering for person tagging. Store media references and metadata in database without copying actual files. Add support for various media formats (JPEG, HEIC, MP4, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Test media library access permissions and scanning performance. Verify EXIF data extraction accuracy. Test face detection and clustering algorithms with various image qualities. Validate metadata storage and retrieval.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate photo_manager package and setup media library access [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add photo_manager dependency and implement basic media library access with proper permissions handling
### Details:
Install photo_manager package, configure platform-specific permissions (iOS Info.plist and Android manifest), implement permission request flow, and create basic media library connection with error handling
<info added on 2025-09-08T20:01:24.610Z>
Package successfully integrated with v3.5.4 installed and added to pubspec.yaml. Platform permissions configured for both iOS (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription, PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert in Info.plist) and Android (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO, READ_MEDIA_AUDIO, READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED for API 34+ with legacy fallbacks in AndroidManifest.xml). PhotoService class implemented with complete functionality including permission handling, photo scanning, album access, thumbnail generation, and change notifications. PhotoPermissionCard UI component created for permission status display and access requests. Service successfully integrated into HomeScreen for testing with providers for permission state, photo discovery stream, and today's photos scanning functionality.

## 2. Implement PhotoService for automated media scanning [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create PhotoService class to discover and scan new photos/videos created each day
### Details:
Build PhotoService with methods to scan device media library, filter by date ranges, track new media items, and implement efficient scanning algorithms with configurable intervals

## 3. Add EXIF metadata extraction using exif package [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive EXIF data extraction including GPS coordinates, timestamps, and camera settings
### Details:
Integrate exif package, extract GPS coordinates, capture timestamps, camera settings (ISO, aperture, focal length), device information, and handle various EXIF data formats with error handling for corrupted metadata

## 4. Integrate google_mlkit_face_detection for on-device face detection [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Setup ML Kit face detection to identify faces in photos with proper configuration
### Details:
Configure google_mlkit_face_detection, implement face detection pipeline, optimize detection parameters for accuracy vs performance, handle various image sizes and qualities, and extract facial landmarks and bounding boxes

## 5. Implement face clustering algorithms for person identification [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Build face clustering system to group detected faces by person for tagging
### Details:
Implement face embedding extraction, clustering algorithms (k-means or DBSCAN), similarity matching for person identification, handle face vector storage, and create person tagging workflow with confidence scoring

## 6. Create media database models and storage schema [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Design and implement database models for storing media references and extracted metadata
### Details:
Create MediaItem, MediaMetadata, and PersonTag database models using Drift, implement relationships between media and metadata, store file references without copying files, and add indices for efficient queries

## 7. Add support for various media formats (JPEG, HEIC, MP4) [done]
### Dependencies: 4.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive media format support including images and videos
### Details:
Handle JPEG, HEIC, PNG image formats, support MP4, MOV video formats, implement format-specific metadata extraction, add thumbnail generation, and handle platform-specific format variations
<info added on 2025-09-08T23:33:57.571Z>
Successfully completed comprehensive media format handler implementation. Added support for 8 image formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF, WebP, GIF, BMP) and 5 video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM). Enhanced PhotoService with format-specific metadata extraction capabilities for both images and videos. Implemented thumbnail generation system with proper format handling. All format detection, metadata extraction, and thumbnail generation features tested and verified working correctly across supported formats.
