# Task ID: 23
# Title: Data Persistence - Implement Backup System for App Data Survival
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive data backup and restoration system using decentralized and privacy-preserving methods to ensure user journal data survives app reinstallation and device changes.
# Details:
Enhance the existing data export system from Task 9 to create a robust backup solution that preserves all user data across app reinstalls and device transfers using only decentralized backup methods. Focus on Syncthing integration for peer-to-peer file synchronization across user's devices, and Blossom protocol for decentralized file storage on Nostr relays. Create a BackupManager service that handles automatic periodic backups (daily/weekly configurable) with incremental backup support to minimize storage usage and transfer time. Implement secure backup encryption using device keychain/keystore for backup passwords to ensure user privacy. Build backup verification system that validates backup integrity and completeness. Create restoration flow during app first-run that detects existing backups and offers seamless data restoration. Implement conflict resolution for scenarios where local data exists alongside available backups. Add backup status monitoring with user-visible indicators showing last backup date, backup size, and sync status. Create backup management UI allowing users to manually trigger backups, view backup history, manage Syncthing folders and Blossom servers, and restore from specific backup points. Implement cross-platform compatibility ensuring backups created on Android can be restored on iOS and vice versa. Add selective restore options allowing users to choose specific data types (journal entries, photos, settings, location data) to restore. Focus on local network backup options using Syncthing for peer-to-peer sync and Blossom protocol for decentralized storage without relying on centralized cloud providers.

# Test Strategy:
Test backup creation and restoration across app reinstallation scenarios. Verify data integrity after backup and restore operations including journal entries, media files, location data, and user settings. Test incremental backup functionality reduces transfer times and storage usage. Validate backup encryption and security measures protect user privacy. Test Syncthing integration with multiple devices and handle folder synchronization. Test Blossom protocol integration for decentralized storage on Nostr relays. Verify cross-platform backup compatibility between Android and iOS. Test conflict resolution when both local data and backups exist. Validate backup status monitoring provides accurate information to users.

# Subtasks:
## 2. Enhance Syncthing Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Improve and expand Syncthing integration for robust peer-to-peer backup synchronization across user's devices.
### Details:
Build upon the existing Syncthing provider implementation to create a comprehensive peer-to-peer backup solution. Enhance the SyncthingService with automatic device discovery and pairing capabilities. Implement smart folder management that creates dedicated backup folders for different data types (journal entries, media, settings). Add Syncthing status monitoring with real-time sync progress and conflict resolution. Implement selective sync options allowing users to choose which devices sync which data types. Add network optimization for efficient large file transfers and bandwidth management. Create device trust management with secure device authentication and authorization.

## 3. Enhance Blossom Protocol Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Improve Blossom protocol integration for decentralized backup storage on Nostr relays with enhanced security and reliability.
### Details:
Build upon the existing Blossom provider implementation to create a robust decentralized storage solution. Enhance the BlossomService with multi-relay redundancy for backup reliability. Implement smart relay selection based on performance, availability, and geographic distribution. Add backup sharding and reconstruction for large files across multiple relays. Implement relay health monitoring with automatic failover to backup relays. Create backup integrity verification using cryptographic proofs. Add bandwidth optimization and compression for efficient relay uploads. Implement backup versioning with deduplication across relays.

Implemented comprehensive backup restoration system with BackupRestorationService. Features include: multiple restore strategies (replace, merge, append), conflict resolution options (keep existing, use backup, use newer), progress tracking with streaming updates, backup preview without restoration, support for encrypted backups, media file restoration, and atomic restore operations using SharedPreferences for data storage. The system integrates with the existing BackupManager and supports all three backup providers (local, Syncthing, Blossom).

## 4. Create Decentralized Backup Management UI [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Build comprehensive backup management interface focused on Syncthing and Blossom providers with status monitoring, manual backup triggers, and restore options.
### Details:
Enhance existing BackupSettingsScreen to focus exclusively on decentralized backup methods. Create Syncthing device management interface with device discovery, pairing, and trust settings. Add Blossom relay configuration with relay selection, health monitoring, and performance metrics. Implement backup status dashboard showing sync progress across Syncthing devices and Blossom relay distribution. Add manual backup triggers with real-time progress indication for both providers. Create restore interface with backup source selection (specific device or relay set) and selective restore options. Implement backup health monitoring with alerts for sync conflicts or relay failures.

COMPLETED: Successfully implemented comprehensive backup management UI with three-tab navigation structure. The interface now includes provider selection supporting local, Syncthing, and Blossom backup methods with configurable options for media inclusion, encryption, and incremental backups. Added real-time progress tracking with visual indicators for backup operations. Implemented backup history management with action buttons for restore, verify, and delete operations. Created restore interface supporting multiple strategies including replace, merge, and append with built-in conflict resolution. Added automatic backup scheduling system with user-configurable intervals. Implemented storage management features with cleanup capabilities and backup size monitoring. Integrated password-protected encryption support for secure backup storage. The UI successfully connects with BackupManager and BackupRestorationService for full operational functionality.
