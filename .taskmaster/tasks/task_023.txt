# Task ID: 23
# Title: Data Persistence - Implement Backup System for App Data Survival
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive data backup and restoration system to ensure user journal data survives app reinstallation and device changes.
# Details:
Enhance the existing data export system from Task 9 to create a robust backup solution that preserves all user data across app reinstalls and device transfers. Implement automatic cloud backup integration with multiple provider options: Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, or user's preferred cloud storage service. Create a BackupManager service that handles automatic periodic backups (daily/weekly configurable) with incremental backup support to minimize storage usage and transfer time. Implement secure backup encryption using device keychain/keystore for backup passwords to ensure user privacy. Build backup verification system that validates backup integrity and completeness. Create restoration flow during app first-run that detects existing backups and offers seamless data restoration. Implement conflict resolution for scenarios where local data exists alongside available backups. Add backup status monitoring with user-visible indicators showing last backup date, backup size, and sync status. Create backup management UI allowing users to manually trigger backups, view backup history, manage storage locations, and restore from specific backup points. Implement cross-platform compatibility ensuring backups created on Android can be restored on iOS and vice versa. Add selective restore options allowing users to choose specific data types (journal entries, photos, settings, location data) to restore. Consider implementing local network backup options for users preferring local-only solutions using Syncthing or similar peer-to-peer sync.

# Test Strategy:
Test backup creation and restoration across app reinstallation scenarios. Verify data integrity after backup and restore operations including journal entries, media files, location data, and user settings. Test incremental backup functionality reduces transfer times and storage usage. Validate backup encryption and security measures protect user privacy. Test cloud storage integration with multiple providers and handle authentication/permission flows. Verify cross-platform backup compatibility between Android and iOS. Test conflict resolution when both local data and backups exist. Validate backup status monitoring provides accurate information to users.
