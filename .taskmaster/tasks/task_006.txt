# Task ID: 6
# Title: On-Device AI Text Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement local AI model for generating daily journal summaries from collected data
# Details:
Integrate tflite_flutter package with a mobile-optimized language model (quantized Gemma or similar). Implement AIService class that processes structured daily data (locations, photos, events) into coherent narrative summaries. Create data synthesis pipeline that converts raw database entries into JSON context for the AI model. Implement prompt engineering for consistent, personalized journal entry generation. Add fallback text templates for when AI processing fails.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI model loading and inference performance on target devices. Verify text generation quality and coherence. Test with various data scenarios (minimal data, rich data, missing data). Benchmark processing time and memory usage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate tflite_flutter package [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add and configure tflite_flutter dependency for on-device AI model execution
### Details:
Add tflite_flutter package to pubspec.yaml and configure platform-specific setup for iOS and Android. Ensure proper native library linking and test basic package functionality.

## 2. Select and optimize mobile language model [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Research, download and prepare quantized Gemma or similar mobile-optimized language model
### Details:
Evaluate available quantized language models (Gemma, TinyLLaMA, etc.) for mobile deployment. Download selected model, convert to TensorFlow Lite format if needed, and optimize for mobile constraints (size, memory, inference speed).

## 3. Implement AIService class architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create core AIService class to manage model loading, inference, and text generation
### Details:
Design and implement AIService singleton class with methods for model initialization, text generation from structured data, and resource management. Include proper error handling and lifecycle management.

## 4. Create data synthesis pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build system to convert raw database entries into structured JSON context for AI model
### Details:
Implement data aggregation logic to collect daily activities (locations, photos, events, calendar items) and format them into structured JSON context that the AI model can process for narrative generation.

## 5. Develop prompt engineering templates [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Design and implement prompt templates for consistent, personalized journal entry generation
### Details:
Create comprehensive prompt templates that guide the AI model to generate coherent, personalized journal summaries. Include templates for different data scenarios and user preferences.

## 6. Add fallback text generation [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Implement fallback text templates for when AI processing fails or is unavailable
### Details:
Create template-based text generation system that can produce basic journal summaries using rule-based approaches when AI model fails or performs poorly. Ensure graceful degradation of functionality.

## 7. Optimize model performance and memory usage [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.5
### Description: Implement performance optimizations for efficient mobile AI inference
### Details:
Optimize model loading, caching strategies, and inference performance. Implement memory management to prevent OOM issues. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection for inference times and resource usage.

## 8. Handle model loading and inference errors [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for AI model operations
### Details:
Add robust error handling for model loading failures, inference errors, and resource constraints. Implement graceful fallbacks, user notifications, and recovery mechanisms. Include logging and debugging capabilities for AI-related issues.
