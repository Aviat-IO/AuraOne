# Task 21: Local AI Models for Daily Summary Generation

## Overview
This task implements a comprehensive on-device AI system that processes location history, movement data, and photos to generate intelligent daily summaries. The system follows a multi-modal pipeline approach that combines spatiotemporal data processing, visual context extraction, and narrative generation.
