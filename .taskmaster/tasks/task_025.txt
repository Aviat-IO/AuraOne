# Priority: medium
# Description: Create event detail functionality for timeline events by implementing the TODO click handler at line 295 in timeline_widget.dart, including navigation to a detailed event view screen.
# Details:
Implement the missing click handler functionality for timeline events in the TimelineWidget. Currently at line 295 in timeline_widget.dart, there is a TODO comment for 'Open event details' in the InkWell onTap callback. This task involves: 1) Creating a new EventDetailScreen to display comprehensive event information including time, title, description, type, duration, related media, and contextual data, 2) Adding the new screen route '/event-detail' to router.dart with proper parameter passing for event data, 3) Implementing the onTap callback in timeline_widget.dart to navigate to EventDetailScreen using context.push() with event data as parameters, 4) Designing the event detail screen with Material 3 styling that shows event metadata, allows editing of event details, and provides options to add notes or media, 5) Adding proper error handling and loading states for the detail screen, 6) Implementing back navigation and proper screen transitions. The detail screen should follow the existing app's design patterns with appropriate use of Material 3 components, proper spacing, and responsive layout.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that tapping on any timeline event properly navigates to the event detail screen with correct event data passed. Test the event detail screen displays all event information accurately including time, title, description, and type. Validate back navigation works correctly from the detail screen. Test the screen layout and responsiveness across different device sizes and orientations. Verify Material 3 styling consistency with the rest of the app. Test error handling when invalid event data is passed. Validate screen transitions and animations are smooth and follow Material Design guidelines.
