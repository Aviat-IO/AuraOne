        "details": "Remove all hardcoded placeholder data from the Today's Summary section in the Overview tab. Implement a proper empty state UI that displays when no real data is available. The empty state should include: 1) A descriptive icon (such as Icons.auto_awesome or Icons.analytics), 2) A clear heading like 'No data yet today', 3) Explanatory text informing users that their daily summary will automatically appear as they use the app throughout the day, 4) Proper styling using Material 3 design tokens with appropriate spacing and typography. Use conditional rendering to show either the real data summary or the empty state based on whether actual user data exists. The empty state should be centered vertically within the available space and use muted colors from the theme's color scheme. Consider adding subtle animations or micro-interactions to make the empty state feel polished rather than broken.",

Test the empty state message displays correctly with proper centering, typography, and spacing. Confirm the empty state uses appropriate Material 3 styling and theme colors. Test the conditional logic by simulating scenarios with and without real data to ensure the correct UI state is shown. Validate that the empty state is responsive across different screen sizes and orientations. Test the transition between empty state and populated data state when real user data becomes available.",

Implement DataAnalysisService that aggregates data from multiple sources: location data from Task 3 (places visited, movement patterns), calendar events from Task 5 (appointments, activities), captured photos and media, and other sensor data. Create a data preprocessing pipeline that converts raw sensor data into structured context for AI analysis. Enhance the existing AI model with specialized prompts for daily summary generation that can identify patterns, significant events, and create coherent narrative summaries. Implement SummaryGenerationService that runs periodically (end of day or on-demand) to process accumulated data and generate personalized text. Add data filtering logic to identify meaningful activities and filter out noise. Create template-based fallback system for days with minimal data. Integrate with existing empty state from Task 16 to populate the Today's Summary section with generated content. Ensure privacy-first approach with all processing happening locally on device.",

Create a VoiceCommandInterpreter that uses natural language processing to parse voice commands and translate them into specific AI editing instructions. Integrate with the on-device AI system from Task 17 to apply these voice commands to modify the generated summary text. Implement a conversational feedback system where the AI reads back changes using text-to-speech and asks for confirmation before applying modifications. Add support for multi-turn voice conversations allowing users to refine edits through follow-up commands. Create a voice command help system that can be activated by saying 'what can I say' or similar phrases.

Implement smooth AnimationController-based transitions (300-400ms duration) that handle: icon vertical position changes (slight upward movement when active), text opacity fade-in/out with slide animation, background color fade-in/out using ColorTween. Use Material 3 design tokens for colors, ensuring the active background uses theme.colorScheme.primaryContainer or secondaryContainer. Implement proper state management to ensure only one tab can be active at a time. Handle rapid tab switching by properly disposing/interrupting ongoing animations to prevent visual glitches.
