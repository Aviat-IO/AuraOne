Changed the generate button icon from Icons.auto_awesome to Icons.add_circle_outline when no journal entry exists, preventing duplicate sparkle icons from appearing in the UI. The solution maintains semantic clarity: the title section keeps its sparkle icon (Icons.auto_awesome) to indicate AI-generated content, while the action button uses a plus icon (Icons.add_circle_outline) for initial generation and a refresh icon for regeneration. This approach eliminates visual confusion while preserving the intended user experience and proper icon semantics for different UI elements.",
