# Title: Implement privacy preset application logic for PrivacyQuickStart screen
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 9, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the privacy preset implementation in PrivacyQuickStart screen by adding actual preset configuration logic and persistence for different privacy levels (Minimal, Balanced, Maximum).
# Details:
Implement the missing privacy preset application logic in the PrivacyQuickStart screen by: 1) Creating a PrivacyPresetService that defines three preset configurations - Minimal (basic location tracking, limited data collection), Balanced (moderate privacy with essential features), and Maximum (comprehensive tracking for full functionality), 2) Adding preset data models that specify exact settings for each privacy level including location tracking frequency, data retention periods, backup destinations, AI processing preferences, and third-party integrations, 3) Implementing the applyPreset() method that updates app-wide privacy settings in SharedPreferences or secure storage, including location services permissions, calendar integration toggles, health data access, and backup method selections, 4) Creating a PrivacySettingsProvider using Riverpod to manage privacy state across the app and ensure all services respect the selected privacy level, 5) Adding validation logic to ensure preset changes properly update dependent services like LocationService, CalendarService, and BackupManager, 6) Implementing preset persistence so the selected privacy level survives app restarts and updates the UI accordingly, 7) Adding proper error handling for cases where preset application fails due to permission issues or service unavailability.

# Test Strategy:
Test each privacy preset selection properly applies the correct configuration settings across all app services. Verify Minimal preset disables non-essential tracking while maintaining core functionality. Test Balanced preset provides reasonable defaults with moderate privacy protection. Validate Maximum preset enables full feature set with appropriate user consent flows. Test preset persistence across app restarts and ensure UI reflects the currently active preset. Verify that changing presets properly updates all dependent services and their permission states. Test error scenarios where preset application might fail and ensure graceful fallback behavior.
