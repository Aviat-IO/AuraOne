# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement journal data import functionality for processing exported journal entries
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the TODO at line 371 in import_screen.dart by implementing the actual import logic to parse exported journal entries, handle duplicates, import media files, and store data in the journal database.
# Details:
Implement the missing import logic in the _performImport() method by: 1) Parsing journal entries from the _importData JSON structure which contains exportPackage.data.journalEntries array with title, content, date, mood, tags, summary, and activities, 2) Validating each journal entry's required fields (date, title, content) and handling malformed data gracefully, 3) Implementing duplicate detection by checking existing entries for the same date using JournalDatabase.getJournalEntryForDate() when _settings.skipDuplicates is enabled, 4) Converting imported entries to JournalEntriesCompanion objects with proper date conversion using DateTimeUtils.localDateToUtc(), handling both auto-generated and user-created entries based on isAutoGenerated flag, 5) Inserting journal entries using JournalDatabase.insertJournalEntry() with InsertMode.insertOrReplace for merging when _settings.mergeEntries is true, 6) Processing associated activities from each entry's activities array and inserting them using JournalDatabase.insertJournalActivity() with proper JSON metadata encoding, 7) Handling media file imports when _settings.importMedia is true by copying files from the temporary _mediaDirectory to the app's media storage directory and updating file references, 8) Processing location data when _settings.importLocation is enabled, ensuring GPS coordinates and location metadata are preserved in activity records, 9) Providing progress updates during the import process by replacing the fake Future.delayed with real progress tracking based on processed entries count, 10) Adding comprehensive error handling for database constraints, file I/O operations, and data validation with specific error messages for different failure scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Test import functionality with various export file formats including minimal entries (title/content only), complete entries with activities and media, and malformed JSON data. Verify duplicate detection works correctly when skipDuplicates is enabled, testing same-date entries with different content. Test merge functionality preserves existing data while adding new information when mergeEntries is enabled. Validate media file import correctly copies files to app storage and updates references when importMedia is true. Test location data import preserves GPS coordinates and geocoding information when importLocation is enabled. Verify progress tracking provides accurate completion percentages during large imports. Test error handling for corrupted files, insufficient storage space, and database constraint violations. Validate the import process leaves the database in a consistent state even when errors occur partway through.
