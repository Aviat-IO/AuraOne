# Title: Implement focus on location map functionality - location card tap handler
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 29, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the TODO at line 428 in map_widget.dart to enable focusing/centering on a specific location when tapping location cards in the daily canvas map widget.
# Details:
Implement the missing 'Focus on location on map' functionality in the MapWidget's location card tap handler by: 1) Creating a MapController provider or state management solution to coordinate between the MapWidget and any actual FlutterMap instances (similar to the existing implementation in home_screen.dart), 2) Adding a callback parameter to MapWidget that can be triggered when location cards are tapped, passing the LocationPoint data including latitude, longitude, and location details, 3) Implementing the onTap handler in _buildLocationCard to trigger map focus functionality that will center the map view on the selected location's coordinates, 4) Adding smooth animation when centering on the location using MapController.move() with appropriate zoom level (e.g., zoom level 16-18 for detailed location view), 5) Adding visual feedback such as highlighting the selected location card and/or showing a temporary marker or pulse effect on the map at the focused location, 6) Ensuring proper integration with the existing location data structure (LocationPoint class) and MapData provider, 7) Adding proper error handling for edge cases like invalid coordinates or map controller not being available. The implementation should work seamlessly with the existing map placeholder and be ready to integrate with the actual FlutterMap implementation when the placeholder is replaced.

# Test Strategy:
Test that tapping on location cards in the horizontal scrollable list triggers the focus functionality. Verify that the map view centers on the correct coordinates for each location card tapped. Test smooth animation when centering occurs and ensure appropriate zoom level for location details. Test that visual feedback (card highlighting or map markers) appears correctly when locations are focused. Validate that the functionality works with various location types (home, work, food, etc.) and handles edge cases like missing coordinates gracefully. Test integration with existing MapController and ensure no conflicts with other map controls from Task 29.
