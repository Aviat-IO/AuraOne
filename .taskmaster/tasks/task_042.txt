# Task ID: 42
# Title: Replace placeholder implementations in photo providers, AI pipeline, pattern analyzer mood analysis, and model manager accuracy test
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 26, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace hardcoded placeholder implementations in photo_providers.dart (empty list returns), ai_pipeline_provider.dart (mock database initialization), pattern_analyzer.dart (hardcoded mood score), and model_manager.dart (hardcoded accuracy value) with functional implementations using existing service infrastructure.
# Details:
Replace four placeholder implementations with functional code: 1) In photo_providers.dart lines 18 and 24 - replace empty list returns in recentPhotosProvider and photosByDateProvider with actual PhotoService integration using ref.watch(photoServiceProvider) and existing PhotoManager methods for fetching real device photos, 2) In ai_pipeline_provider.dart line 28-30 - replace placeholder MediaDatabase() and LocationDatabase() instantiation with proper provider references using ref.read(mediaDatabaseProvider) and ref.read(locationDatabaseProvider), 3) In pattern_analyzer.dart line 371-377 - replace hardcoded MoodDataPoint placeholder with sentiment analysis implementation that extracts mood data from summary.aiInsights using natural language processing patterns for mood classification (positive/neutral/negative), triggers extraction, and confidence scoring based on insight content quality, 4) In model_manager.dart line 379 - replace hardcoded accuracy value 0.85 with actual model accuracy testing using a validation dataset or cross-validation approach measuring prediction accuracy against ground truth data for the specific model being benchmarked.

# Test Strategy:
Test photo providers by verifying recentPhotosProvider returns actual device photos when photo permissions are granted and photosByDateProvider filters photos by the specified date. Test AI pipeline provider by ensuring MediaDatabase and LocationDatabase are properly injected from existing providers and comprehensive tests run without initialization errors. Test pattern analyzer mood analysis by providing various AI insight texts and verifying mood scores, categories, and triggers are extracted based on content sentiment rather than returning hardcoded values. Test model manager accuracy by running benchmark tests with actual model files and verifying accuracy scores reflect real model performance metrics rather than placeholder values.
