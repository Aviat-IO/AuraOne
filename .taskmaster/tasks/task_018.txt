# Task ID: 18
# Title: Voice Command Interface for AI Summary Editing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 17, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a voice command system that allows users to issue spoken commands to modify and update their AI-generated daily summary text through natural language instructions.
# Details:
Build upon the existing voice-to-text editing system from Task 7 to create a comprehensive voice command interface specifically for AI summary editing. Implement an enhanced VoiceCommandProcessor that extends the existing VoiceEditingService to handle AI-specific editing commands such as 'make the summary more detailed', 'shorten the afternoon section', 'add more emotion to the description', or 'rewrite in a more professional tone'. Create a VoiceCommandInterpreter that uses natural language processing to parse voice commands and translate them into specific AI editing instructions. Integrate with the on-device AI system from Task 17 to apply these voice commands to modify the generated summary text. Implement a conversational feedback system where the AI reads back changes using text-to-speech and asks for confirmation before applying modifications. Add support for multi-turn voice conversations allowing users to refine edits through follow-up commands. Create a voice command help system that can be activated by saying 'what can I say' or similar phrases. Ensure the interface works seamlessly with the existing Today's Summary section in the Overview tab, providing visual feedback during voice processing and displaying real-time text changes as they occur.

# Test Strategy:
Test voice command recognition accuracy for various AI editing instructions including tone changes, content additions/deletions, and style modifications. Verify that voice commands properly integrate with the AI summary generation system and produce appropriate text modifications. Test multi-turn conversations to ensure context is maintained across multiple voice commands. Validate text-to-speech feedback system reads back changes clearly and requests appropriate confirmations. Test voice command help system provides useful guidance on available commands. Verify visual feedback during voice processing and ensure seamless integration with the Overview tab's Today's Summary section. Test performance and responsiveness when processing complex editing commands through the AI system.
