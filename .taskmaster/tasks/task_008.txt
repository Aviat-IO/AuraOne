# Task ID: 8
# Title: Home Page with Sub-tabs Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the home page interface with three sub-tabs (Overview, Map, Media) that appear above the main bottom tabs
# Details:
Build home page with sub-tab navigation that appears directly above the main bottom tabs, only visible when Home is selected. Overview tab displays AI-generated text summary (editable with simple text editor - no formatting) plus daily stats (photos taken, distance traveled, active time). Map tab shows locations visited that day using flutter_map. Media tab displays photos taken that day in an optimized gallery. Sub-tabs should be visually distinct from main navigation. Add skeleton loading states with skeletonizer. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI responsiveness across different screen sizes and orientations. Verify sub-tab navigation works correctly and only appears on home page. Test map integration and location visualization. Validate media gallery performance with large photo collections. Test simple text editing functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design home page layout with sub-tabs structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall layout architecture for the home page with sub-tab navigation that appears above bottom tabs
### Details:
Design the main home page scaffold with sub-tab bar positioned above the bottom navigation tabs. Create responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Define widget hierarchy and state management approach using Riverpod providers. Implement navigation between Overview, Map, and Media sub-tabs. Ensure sub-tabs only show when Home tab is selected.

## 2. Implement Overview sub-tab with AI summary and stats [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build Overview tab showing AI-generated text summary and daily statistics
### Details:
Create Overview tab content with AI-generated daily summary displayed in a simple editable text field (no formatting/markdown). Add daily statistics section showing photos taken count, distance traveled, and active time. Implement simple text editing for the AI summary. Create clean layout with good typography and spacing.

## 3. Implement Map sub-tab with daily locations [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build Map tab to display locations visited during the day
### Details:
Integrate flutter_map package with OpenStreetMap tiles. Implement location plotting from GPS metadata and location events. Add route visualization for daily movements. Create location markers and pop-ups for significant places. Handle map interactions, zoom controls, and location clustering for better performance.

## 4. Implement Media sub-tab with daily photos [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build Media tab to display photos taken during the day using cached_network_image and easy_image_viewer
### Details:
Implement grid layout for media thumbnails using cached_network_image for performance. Integrate easy_image_viewer for full-screen photo viewing with gestures. Add video playback support using video_player or similar. Implement lazy loading and memory management for large media collections. Create smooth transitions and animations for media interactions.

## 5. Implement sub-tab navigation controls [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create navigation controls for switching between Overview, Map, and Media sub-tabs
### Details:
Create TabBar widget for sub-tab navigation positioned above bottom navigation. Implement TabController for managing sub-tab state. Style sub-tabs to be visually distinct from main navigation. Add smooth transition animations between sub-tabs. Ensure sub-tabs only display when Home tab is active.

## 6. Add skeleton loading states with skeletonizer [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Implement loading placeholders using skeletonizer package for smooth user experience during data loading
### Details:
Create skeleton placeholders for Overview stats, Map, and Media gallery components. Implement loading states that match the actual component layouts. Add smooth transitions from skeleton to loaded content. Handle different loading scenarios (AI generation, location loading, media processing).

## 7. Ensure responsive design across screen sizes [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Optimize layout and interactions for various device screen sizes and orientations
### Details:
Implement responsive breakpoints for phone, tablet, and desktop layouts. Optimize component sizing and spacing for different screen densities. Handle orientation changes gracefully. Test and adjust layouts for accessibility requirements. Ensure touch targets meet platform guidelines across all screen sizes.
