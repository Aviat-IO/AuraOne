# Title: UI Fix - Remove Duplicate Sparkle Icons from Today's Summary
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the UI issue where multiple sparkle icons appear on the Today's Summary page when only one should be displayed.
# Details:
Fixed the duplicate sparkle icon issue in Today's Summary section by implementing proper icon differentiation. Changed the generate button icon from Icons.auto_awesome to Icons.add_circle_outline when no journal entry exists, preventing duplicate sparkle icons from appearing in the UI. The solution maintains semantic clarity: the title section keeps its sparkle icon (Icons.auto_awesome) to indicate AI-generated content, while the action button uses a plus icon (Icons.add_circle_outline) for initial generation and a refresh icon for regeneration. This approach eliminates visual confusion while preserving the intended user experience and proper icon semantics for different UI elements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that only one sparkle icon appears in the Today's Summary section - specifically on the title/header area only. Test that the generate button shows Icons.add_circle_outline (plus icon) when no journal entry exists and Icons.refresh when regenerating content. Validate proper icon differentiation across all UI states (loading, empty, populated with content). Test various screen sizes and orientations to ensure the fix works consistently. Verify that both icons maintain proper styling, animation, and accessibility attributes as intended in the design.
